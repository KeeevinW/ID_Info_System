# ID_Info_System

## Description
This website was developed during my internship at ICBC, Guangxi, under the mentorship of Mr. Wu. It serves as a practical exercise in building web applications using Java Spring Boot framework, combined with other technologies such as MyBatis and FreeMarker Java Template Engine. On this website, after registering with a username, a password, a valid China Resident Identity Card Number, and a phone number, users can log in with a phone number/username, and the corresponding password. The main page will display the information extracted from the users' China Resident Identity Card Number, including address and birthday. If logged in as an admin, the user can view the information of all users, and make changes.

### Technologies Included

- Java Spring Boot framework
- RESTful API
- Freemarker (template engine)
- MyBatis (ORM framework)
- SQL & MySQL
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption
- HttpClient
